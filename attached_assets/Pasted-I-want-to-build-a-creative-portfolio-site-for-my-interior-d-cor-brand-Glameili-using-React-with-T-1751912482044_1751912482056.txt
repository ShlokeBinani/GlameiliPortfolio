I want to build a creative portfolio site for my interior décor brand, Glameili, using React (with TypeScript, .tsx files) and CSS modules. The theme must be ochre yellow and beige—absolutely no white anywhere. The site should be extremely dynamic and visually rich, with the following requirements:

1. Navbar
Fixed at the top, ochre yellow background, beige text.

Links: Home, About Me, Gallery, Contact.

Responsive and always visible.

2. Home Section
Centered animated “Glameili” text using a variable font (Roboto Flex) and the VariableProximity effect: each letter animates (weight changes) as the mouse moves near it.

The “Glameili” text should fade out, then reveal the next animation.

Below, an animated tagline: “Let us Help Decorate your Home & Workplace” with a moving ochre/beige gradient text effect (see GradientText component).

No white backgrounds—use only ochre and beige.

3. About Section
Brand logo in the top left, animated (e.g., slow infinite spin or pulse).

To the right, animated about text using a GSAP scramble-in effect (ScrambledText):
“Glameili is a premier interior décor company dedicated to transforming homes and workplaces with innovative designs and impeccable craftsmanship.”

Monospace font for the animated text.

Beige background.

4. Work Showcase Section
Show a “before” image of a site.

On hover, a glassy, translucent “See Complete” button appears.

On click, fade out the old image and fade in the “after” image (the completed site).

Button must look glassy, not white.

5. Gallery Section
Two large animated boxes: “Residential” and “Commercial Work.”

Each box expands (scales up) on hover.

On click, show images related to that category (use placeholders for now).

Ochre background.

6. Contact Form
Glassmorphism style: blurry, translucent background (no white).

Fields: Email and Message.

Integrate with Formspree (show me where to put my Formspree form ID).

Show dynamic error and success messages.

7. Footer
Address: 26 Bangur Avenue Kolkata-700055

Email: glameilidecor@gmail.com

Phone: 9874042338

Beige background, dark text.

8. Global Animations
Parallax scroll effect for section backgrounds.

Custom “Gemini” scrollbar: ochre thumb, beige track.

No white backgrounds or elements.

Instructions:

Show me all terminal commands to create folders/files from scratch.

Provide all code fully—React components in .tsx files, CSS modules, and where to place each file.

Tell me how to add images (logo, before/after, gallery placeholders) and where to put them.

Give every step, including how to install dependencies and integrate Formspree.

The final site must be ready to deploy, fully animated, and visually stunning, matching the above requirements exactly.
