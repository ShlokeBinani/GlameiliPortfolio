```
public/images/showcase/
â”œâ”€â”€ living-room-before.jpg      ðŸ‘ˆ Your before images
â”œâ”€â”€ living-room-after.jpg       ðŸ‘ˆ Your after images  
â”œâ”€â”€ kitchen-before.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ kitchen-after.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ bedroom-before.jpg
â”œâ”€â”€ bedroom-after.jpg
â””â”€â”€ office-before.png
â””â”€â”€ office-after.png
```

**To add more image pairs:**

2. Edit `client/src/components/Hero.tsx` and add to the `imagePairs` array:
```javascript
{
  before: "/images/showcase/your-project-before.jpg",
  after: "/images/showcase/your-project-after.jpg", 
  title: "Your Project Title"
}
```

   ```
2. **Put both files** in `public/images/gallery/transition-to-complete/`
3. **They'll automatically pair up** and become interactive!
